These visualizations are always a license nightmare...

Feel free to reuse all Lua code in your own visualizations.

The 32c3 logos are from https://events.ccc.de/congress/2015/wiki/Static:Design

img_* - images from twitter #32c3 picked during the conference. Unfortunately
there's no easy way to check who created them now. So they are included to
recreate the original display content that was running during the conference.
I'd suggest you don't use them in your own visualization.

ads_* - images created by 32c3 attendees during the conference. No idea about
the license of those. You might not want to reuse them in your own
visualizations.
