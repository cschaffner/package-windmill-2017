In 2016, we initiated \"Storm from the SEA\" and we promoted Solidarity, Excellence and Audacious as our core values. We pushed the AUDACE to ask the girls to train 3 times a week (twice on field and once in the gym) from april to august. It ended up we learned a lot about frisbee, physical endurance and team bounding!!! \r\n\r\nLast year, we became a family. And as soon as the season finished, we decided to come back together in 2017 to go to the end of the project together ALL IN. So we were back on field in october to prepare summer 2017! We run, jumped and squatted in the snow (just kidding!!! Haha :-). We decided to go ALL IN and pay a $mall fortune to train inside all winter long, again on field and in gym!\r\n\r\nSo we are now ready for more! We want to cross the ocean and show Europe the BIG TIGER we had grown up to be!!! Cause in the end...

We started out as a Mixed-Team in 2008, when a small group in our little town of Klosterneuburg thought it would be fun to play some Ultimate. A few years and quite some work from a bunch of people later, we are proud to call ourselfs one of the biggest Ultimate-Clubs of Austria, with currently around 65 active members.\r\nWe have a group of around 10 players among us, who have proven themselves in Austrias National Teams and some well known Open and Women Teams in the last few years. The international career of the Mosquitos as a Team only started in 2015 though, with our first attendance of the G-Spot Tournament in Ghent. And we loved it! And we want more!\r\nNow, our next goal is to take it one step further this year and also visit Amsterdam for the first time to introduce us to all the people and teams from all around the world. We sincerely hope for a Spot, so we can show everybody how a small Austrian town can provide high spirit, competitive Ultimate and great fun all a once.\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nthe Mosquitos",
